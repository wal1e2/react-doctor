Let coding agents diagnose and fix your React code.

One command scans your codebase for security, performance, correctness, and architecture issues, then outputs a **0–100 score** with actionable diagnostics.

## Install

Run this at your project root:

```bash
npx -y react-doctor@latest .
```

Use `--verbose` to see affected files and line numbers:

```bash
npx -y react-doctor@latest . --verbose
```

## Install as a skill

Add React Doctor's rules as a [skill](https://skills.sh) for your coding agent:

```bash
npx skills add aidenybai/react-doctor
```

This gives agents like Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, and others access to all 47+ React best practice rules. The CLI will also prompt to install the skill on first run.
